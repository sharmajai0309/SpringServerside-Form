Server-Side Form Validation in Spring MVC

📝 Form Submission: Users submit data through forms, which is then sent to a Spring MVC controller for processing.
🔗 Data Binding: Utilize @ModelAttribute to bind form data to a Java object, paving the way for easy validation.
🛠️ Validation Logic: Leverage Spring's Validator interface to define validation rules either through annotations or custom logic.
👩‍💻 Validation Invocation: Invoke the validator's validate() method in your controller, passing the form object and a BindingResult to catch validation errors.
🚫 Handling Errors: If validation fails, errors are populated in the BindingResult. Handle these errors gracefully, perhaps by returning the form view with error messages.
🔍 Displaying Errors: Ensure a seamless user experience by presenting validation errors next to relevant form fields in your view.
💡 Implementing server-side form validation not only maintains data integrity but also enhances user experience. Don't skip this crucial step in your Spring MVC projects!
